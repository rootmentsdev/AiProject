## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- **DSR Data**: Fetched from Google Sheets (existing functionality)
- **Cancellation Data**: Fetched from your rental API using the provided endpoint

### 2. Analysis Process
1. **DSR Analysis**: Identifies problem stores and calculates losses
2. **Cancellation Analysis**: Analyzes cancellation patterns and reasons
3. **Comparison Analysis**: Finds correlations between DSR losses and cancellations
4. **Action Plan Generation**: Creates comprehensive action plans using AI

### 3. AI-Powered Insights
The system uses AI to:
- Identify root causes of problems
- Correlate data between different sources
- Generate specific, actionable recommendations
- Create prioritized action plans with timelines
- Assess risks and provide mitigation strategies

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Access the System
- Start the backend server: `npm start` in the backend directory
- Start the frontend: `npm run dev` in the frontend directory
- Navigate to the "AI Integrated Analysis" tab

### 2. Configure Analysis
- Set date range (DateFrom, DateTo)
- Specify LocationID (0 for all locations)
- Set UserID (default: 7777)

### 3. Run Analysis
- **Run Integrated Analysis**: Complete analysis with action plan
- **Generate Action Plan**: Action plan only
- **Get Cancellation Data**: Cancellation data only
- **Quick Analysis**: Summary insights

### 4. Review Results
- View analysis results in real-time
- Check quick insights and recommendations
- Open action plan modal for detailed view
- Export action plans to CSV
