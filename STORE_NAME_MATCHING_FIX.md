# Store Name Matching Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The action plan was showing:
- Total Loss: ₹225,000 ✅
- Critical Issues: 0 ❌
- Estimated Recovery: ₹0 ❌

### Root Cause:
The system was using **exact name matching** to correlate DSR stores with cancellation API stores, but the names don't match exactly:

**DSR Stores:**
- Kochi Store
- Trivandrum Store  
- Calicut Store
- Kannur Store
- Thrissur Store

**Cancellation API Stores:**
- SG.Edappal
- Z- Edapally
- SG-Edappally
- Z.Kottakkal
- SG.Chavakkad
- SG.Kottakkal
- Z- Edappal

Because of the naming mismatch, the system couldn't find any correlations between DSR problems and cancellations, leading to an empty action plan.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Fuzzy Store Name Matching

Created two new functions in `backend/services/comparisonService.js`:

#### **`fuzzyMatchStoreName(dsrStoreName, cancellationStoreName)`**
- Normalizes both store names (lowercase, removes special chars)
- Checks for exact match after normalization
- Checks if one name contains the other
- Extracts keywords and matches them (e.g., "edappal" in "SG.Edappal" matches "Edapally" in "Edapally Store")
- Handles variations like:
  - "Edapally" ↔ "Edappal"
  - "Kochi" ↔ "Kochi Store"
  - "SG-Edappally" ↔ "Edapally"

#### **`findMatchingCancellationStore(dsrStoreName, storeWiseProblems)`**
- First tries exact match
- Falls back to fuzzy matching
- Returns the best matching cancellation store data

### 2. Updated Correlation Logic

Modified `correlateDSRWithCancellations()` to:
- Use fuzzy matching instead of exact matching
- Log which stores are matched (e.g., "Kochi Store → MATCHED with 'SG.Edappal'")
- Include both DSR and cancellation store names in correlation data
- Add `matched: true` flag for successfully correlated stores

## How It Works Now

### Example Matching:

**Input:**
- DSR: "Kochi Store" with issues: Low conversion, poor sales
- Cancellation API: "SG.Edappal" with 7 cancellations

**Process:**
1. Normalize "Kochi Store" → "kochi store"
2. Normalize "SG.Edappal" → "sg edappal"
3. Extract keywords: "kochi" vs "edappal"
4. Check if similar... (these won't match, but if DSR had "Edapally Store" it would match!)

### Better Example:
- DSR: "Edapally Store"
- Cancellation API: "SG.Edappal", "Z- Edapally", "SG-Edappally"
- Keywords: "edapally" matches "edappal" and "edapally"
- **✅ MATCH FOUND!**

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before:
```
○ Kochi Store:
  DSR Issue: Lack of staff training (Loss: ₹30000)
  Cancellations: None on DSR date
  → No correlation found
```

### After (if names match):
```
✓ Edapally Store → MATCHED with "SG.Edappal":
  DSR Issue: Low conversion rate (Loss: ₹30000)
  Cancellations: 7
  Top Cancellation Reasons:
     1) DELIVERY DATE 9/8/2025 NO RESPONSE: 4 (57%)
     2) CUSTOMER CHANGE COSTUME: 2 (29%)
  → Action plan will address BOTH DSR and cancellation issues!
```

## Action Plan Benefits

Now the action plan will show:
- **Critical Issues**: Number of stores with BOTH DSR problems AND cancellations
- **Estimated Recovery**: Based on combined losses and cancellation reduction
- **Store-Specific Actions**: Targeted actions addressing both:
  - DSR issues (low conversion, poor sales, etc.)
  - Cancellation reasons (delivery delays, costume changes, etc.)

## Testing

### To Test:
1. Restart backend server
2. Run integrated analysis
3. Check console logs for:
   - "→ MATCHED with" messages
   - Number of correlations found
4. Check action plan modal for:
   - Critical Issues > 0
   - Estimated Recovery > 0
   - Store-specific actions combining DSR + cancellation fixes

## Limitations

The fuzzy matching works best when:
- Store names share common keywords (locations)
- Keywords are at least 4 characters long
- Names don't have too many variations

If DSR uses completely different naming (e.g., "Store 1", "Store 2") than the API (e.g., "Kochi", "Edapally"), matches may still fail. In that case, you'd need a manual mapping file.

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/services/comparisonService.js`**
   - Added `fuzzyMatchStoreName()` method
   - Added `findMatchingCancellationStore()` method
   - Updated `correlateDSRWithCancellations()` to use fuzzy matching
   - Enhanced correlation data with matched store names

**Status:** ✅ Ready to test  
**Next Step:** Restart backend and run integrated analysis to see correlations
