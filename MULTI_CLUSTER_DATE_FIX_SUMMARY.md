# Multi-Cluster Date Handling Fix

## Problem Identified

The system was not showing cancellation data for **Kannur** (and other North Cluster stores) because:

1. **Two sheets with different dates:**
   - South Cluster: `12/8/2025`
   - North Cluster: `21/8/2025`

2. **Previous behavior:**
   - System prioritized South Cluster date (`southData.date || northData.date`)
   - Fetched cancellations ONLY for `12/8/2025`
   - Missed Kannur's cancellations that occurred on `21/8/2025`

3. **Why fuzzy matching wasn't the issue:**
   - Store name matching was working correctly (`SG.Kannur` → `KANNUR`)
   - The problem was temporal, not spatial - wrong date being queried

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Date Priority (`dsrModel.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const sheetDate = southData.date || northData.date;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const sheetDate = northData.date || southData.date;
```

- Now prioritizes the **most recent date** (North: 21/8/2025)
- Returns both dates in the result object for reference

### 2. Created Date Range Function (`dateConverter.js`)

Added `convertMultipleDatesToRange()` function:
- Takes multiple DSR dates as input
- Finds the **earliest** and **latest** dates
- Returns a date range covering both: `12/8/2025` to `21/8/2025`

**Example:**
```javascript
convertMultipleDatesToRange(["12/8/2025", "21/8/2025"])
// Returns: { DateFrom: "2025-8-12", DateTo: "2025-8-21" }
```

### 3. Updated Controller Logic (`dsrController.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
const dsrSheetDate = dsrDataResult.date || "12/8/2025";
const cancellationDateRange = convertDSRDateToDateRange(dsrSheetDate);
// Fetched cancellations for single date only
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Create date range covering BOTH cluster dates
cancellationDateRange = convertMultipleDatesToRange([
  dsrDataResult.southDate,
  dsrDataResult.northDate
]);
// Fetches cancellations for date range: 2025-8-12 to 2025-8-21
```

### 4. Benefits

✅ **Automatically covers both dates** - No need to manually sync sheets  
✅ **Staff performance data also fixed** - Uses same date range  
✅ **Better logging** - Shows both cluster dates in terminal  
✅ **Backwards compatible** - Falls back to single date if only one cluster exists

## How It Works Now

1. **Fetch DSR data** from both clusters (South: 12/8, North: 21/8)
2. **Extract dates** from both sheets separately
3. **Create date range** from earliest to latest (12/8 to 21/8)
4. **Fetch cancellations** for entire date range
5. **Fetch staff performance** for entire date range
6. **Match stores** using fuzzy logic
7. **Display results** with all cancellations visible

## Terminal Output (Expected)

```
📍 Fetching SOUTH CLUSTER data...
📅 Found South Cluster date: 12/8/2025

📍 Fetching NORTH CLUSTER data...
📅 Found North Cluster date: 21/8/2025

✅ COMBINED DATA FROM BOTH CLUSTERS
📅 South Cluster Date: 12/8/2025
📅 North Cluster Date: 21/8/2025
📅 Using date for cancellation/staff analysis: 21/8/2025

📊 Step 2: Fetching cancellation data...
📅 Combined date range: 2025-8-12 to 2025-8-21
📅 Fetching cancellations for date range: 2025-8-12 to 2025-8-21

✓ CANCELLATION MATCH: "KANNUR" → "SG.Kannur"
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Kannur cancellations now appear in the frontend
- [x] South Cluster stores (Edappally, etc.) still show their cancellations
- [x] Staff performance data fetched for correct date range
- [x] Terminal shows both cluster dates clearly
- [x] No linter errors

## Related Files Modified

1. `backend/models/dsrModel.js` - Date priority and return values
2. `backend/utils/dateConverter.js` - Multi-date range function
3. `backend/controllers/dsrController.js` - Date range fetching logic

## Future Considerations

If clusters continue to have significantly different dates (>7 days), consider:
- Fetching cancellations separately per cluster
- Adding a date validation warning in the UI
- Auto-selecting the most relevant date per store

---
**Date Fixed:** October 25, 2025  
**Issue:** Kannur cancellations not showing in frontend  
**Root Cause:** South Cluster date (12/8) was being used instead of North Cluster date (21/8)  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
