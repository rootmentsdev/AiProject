# Loss of Sale Action Plan Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the AI prompt to **require specific action items addressing loss of sale data** in all generated action plans. The AI will now create targeted strategies to reduce customer losses based on the specific products and reasons shown in the loss of sale analysis.

## Changes Made

### Backend Enhancement (`backend/controllers/dsrController.js`)

#### 1. Enhanced Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)
**Added Requirements:**
- At least 1-2 immediate actions MUST address lost customers
- Reference SPECIFIC products customers wanted
- Examples provided:
  - "Check inventory for 'grey suit' and 'double breasted suit' requested by lost customers"
  - "Call X lost customers to understand their needs"

**Code Location:** Lines 1067-1074

```javascript
if (staffPerformanceData?.lossOfSaleDetails && staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost > 0) {
  prompt += `   \n   üö® LOSS OF SALE REQUIREMENT:\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ At least 1-2 immediate actions MUST address the ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customers\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Reference the SPECIFIC products customers wanted (from "What Customers Wanted" section)\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Example: "Check inventory for 'grey suit' and 'double breasted suit' requested by lost customers"\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Example: "Call ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customers to understand their needs"\n`;
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Short-Term Actions (1-2 weeks)
**Added Requirements:**
- At least 1-2 short-term actions MUST reduce lost customers
- Stock SPECIFIC products customers wanted
- Set MEASURABLE targets
- Example: "Reduce loss of sale from X to 0 by stocking requested products within 2 weeks"
- Address product unavailability issues

**Code Location:** Lines 1085-1092

```javascript
if (staffPerformanceData?.lossOfSaleDetails && staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost > 0) {
  prompt += `   \n   üö® LOSS OF SALE REQUIREMENT:\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ At least 1-2 short-term actions MUST reduce the ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customers\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Stock the SPECIFIC products customers wanted (reference "What Customers Wanted" section)\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Set MEASURABLE targets: "Reduce loss of sale from ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} to 0 by stocking requested products within 2 weeks"\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Address product unavailability issues mentioned in the data\n`;
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Long-Term Actions (1-3 months)
**Added Requirements:**
- At least 1 long-term action MUST create a system to prevent future loss of sales
- Examples:
  - "Implement inventory management system tracking customer requests to prevent X lost sales monthly"
  - "Create customer needs database from X lost customer records to guide procurement"
- Focus on PREVENTING similar losses in the future

**Code Location:** Lines 1101-1108

```javascript
if (staffPerformanceData?.lossOfSaleDetails && staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost > 0) {
  prompt += `   \n   üö® LOSS OF SALE REQUIREMENT:\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ At least 1 long-term action MUST create a system to prevent future loss of sales\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Example: "Implement inventory management system tracking customer requests to prevent ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost sales monthly"\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Example: "Create customer needs database from ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customer records to guide procurement"\n`;
  prompt += `   ‚Ä¢ Focus on PREVENTING similar losses in the future\n`;
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced Expected Impact
**Added Requirements:**
- Include loss of sale reduction targets in expected impact statement
- Example: "...reduce loss of sale from X to 0, improve conversion to 70% in 2 months"

**Code Location:** Lines 1114-1122

```javascript
const lossOfSaleImpact = staffPerformanceData?.lossOfSaleDetails?.totalLost > 0 
  ? `, reduce loss of sale from ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} to 0` 
  : '';
```

#### 5. Added Critical Requirements Section
**New Requirements:**
- MUST address the X lost customers in action plans
- MUST reference SPECIFIC products from "What Customers Wanted" section
- MUST create actions to STOCK those specific products
- MUST include measurable targets to REDUCE loss of sale to 0
- Example: "Stock 'grey suit' and 'double breasted suit' requested by X lost customers within 5 days"

**Code Location:** Lines 1133-1140

```javascript
if (staffPerformanceData?.lossOfSaleDetails && staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost > 0) {
  prompt += `\nüö® LOSS OF SALE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n`;
  prompt += `‚Ä¢ MUST address the ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customers in your action plans\n`;
  prompt += `‚Ä¢ MUST reference SPECIFIC products from "What Customers Wanted" section\n`;
  prompt += `‚Ä¢ MUST create actions to STOCK those specific products\n`;
  prompt += `‚Ä¢ MUST include measurable targets to REDUCE loss of sale to 0\n`;
  prompt += `‚Ä¢ Example: "Stock 'grey suit' and 'double breasted suit' requested by ${staffPerformanceData.lossOfSaleDetails.totalLost} lost customers within 5 days"\n\n`;
}
```

## Expected Results

### Before Enhancement
AI action plans were generic and did not specifically address loss of sale data:
- ‚ùå "Improve inventory management"
- ‚ùå "Follow up with customers"
- ‚ùå "Train staff on customer service"

### After Enhancement
AI action plans will be specific and data-driven:

#### For KANNUR (3 lost customers):
**Immediate Actions:**
- ‚úÖ "Check inventory for 'blazer' requested by 3 lost customers today"
- ‚úÖ "Call 3 lost customers (enquiry blazer only, GROOM NOT COME, will come later) to understand needs"

**Short-Term Actions:**
- ‚úÖ "Stock blazer products within 1 week to reduce loss of sale from 3 to 0"
- ‚úÖ "Address groom scheduling issues by implementing pre-booking system for 3 lost cases"

**Long-Term Actions:**
- ‚úÖ "Implement customer request tracking system to prevent 3 monthly lost sales"
- ‚úÖ "Create customer needs database from 3 lost customer records to guide procurement"

**Expected Impact:**
- ‚úÖ "Reduce cancellations by 40%, recover ‚Çπ1, reduce loss of sale from 3 to 0, improve conversion to 70% in 2 months"

#### For KOTTAYAM (2 lost customers):
**Immediate Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Review specific needs of 2 lost customers
- ‚úÖ Identify missing products from loss of sale data

**Short-Term Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Stock requested products within 2 weeks
- ‚úÖ Reduce loss of sale from 2 to 0

**Long-Term Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Create system to track and prevent future losses

1. Loss of sale data fetched from Google Sheets (already implemented)
2. Data passed to AI in prompt (already implemented)
3. **NEW:** AI prompt now REQUIRES specific actions addressing loss of sale
4. **NEW:** AI must reference specific products customers wanted
5. **NEW:** AI must include measurable targets (X to 0)
6. **NEW:** AI must create systems to prevent future losses
7. Action plan displayed in frontend with loss of sale analysis section

### Data Flow
